Current content is based on the template from [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html), re-downloading the template or visiting that site provides directions for adding extra content e.g. banners, navigation, cards

To test the site locally, an easy way is to

1. Check out a copy of the repository
2. Open a terminal and go into the repository folder
3. Run `python -m http.server` 
4. The site will now be available at `http://localhost:8000` or similar (the command will print out the port, if 8000 is already in use)
